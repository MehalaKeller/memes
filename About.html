            <p>dank (adj.)anything “dank” is accepted as good, funny, important, and smart. Qualities which, in the meme scene, strongly correlate to obscurity , not uncommonly, sheer incomprehensibility.</p>
            <p>@harryseaton "Daddy how did you meet Mummy?" "Well child I first @'d sadthatcher69 in 2015 with a dank meme and the rest is on my timehop"</p>

           <p>fire (adj.) Probably the closest analogue to the overplayed “viral” right now, though it also refers to a particular conflagration of “dankness.” The fire emoji is a customary equivalent. To be fire is what it once colloquially meant to be on fire. N.B. that any fire preceded by “dumpster” or “trash” is what we once called a “cluster.”</p>

           <p>lit (adj.) If music and memes can be fire, then parties and communities can be “lit,” which is to say marked by boisterous, enjoyable, and sometimes outlandish activity.</p>
           <p>@kaleya_daniel "New menu, uniforms, AND chairs. Applebee's is lit."</p>

          <p>no chill (n.) Though one cannot exactly possess “chill,” the aspect of unruffled, ambivalent calm, one can be said to have “no chill” if one persists in endless trolling, antagonism, or other malicious endeavors. In other words, you can’t leave well enough alone.</p>

          <p>A meme is a virally-transmitted photograph that is embellished with text that pokes fun at a cultural symbol or social idea.</p>
          <p>The majority of modern memes are captioned photos that are intended to be funny, often as a way to publicly ridicule human behavior. Other memes can be videos and verbal expressions. Some memes have heavier and more philosophical content.</p>
          <p>The world of memes (which rhymes with 'teams') is noteworthy for two reasons: it is a worldwide social phenomenon, and memes behave like a mass of infectious flu and cold viruses, traveling from person to person quickly through social media.</p>
