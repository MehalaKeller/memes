            <p>Memes are a way of communicating jokes and ideas through a wide variety of formats. Memes can vary in content type from the logical <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/expanding-brain">Expanding Brain Meme</a>, to the nonsensical <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/beanos">Beanos</a> meme. Originally, memes followed a simple format where you'd take an image and apply top and bottom text in the Impact font, and submit it. Nowadays, memes have become much more varied in appearance and type. There are even types that are video based, such as the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/beanos">Beanos</a> meme. This page was dedicated to the acknowledgement and record-keeping of some of the most popular memes found in today's media, as well as sentencing certain memes to death for either overuse or underuse</p>

           <p>In recent years, memes have begun to die off much quicker than ever before. When memes initially became popular, the formats that were used lasted for years on end without signs of slowing. Nowadays, memes are lucky to last more than a month or two. The main reason for this is oversatuartion. With more content creators than ever before, memes are being produced at an unsustainable rate. With things progressing as they are, it's entirely possible that future memes will last a week at most before they're considered "dead" and thrown to the side.</p>
